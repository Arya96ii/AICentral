There once was a man with a plan
To write a test for OpenAI's chatbot clan
He typed and he typed, but alas
His brain was scrambled like eggs in a glass

He tried to ask for help from a friend
But they were busy with a task that never ends
So he sat there alone, in despair
Wondering if his chatbot test would ever be fair.
